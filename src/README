This server implements several web services and file serving. Multiple clients
are supported by using epoll to multiplex several connections per thread. All
read operations are nonblocking. Write operations are currently blocking.  IPV4
is supported by binding an IPV6 socket and using dual-binding to accept 
connections from both types of addresses.
